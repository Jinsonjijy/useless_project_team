### Project Documentation

‚ÄúThe alarm that says it‚Äôs ringing, but never actually does‚Äù
For those who set alarms they never intend to wake up to, *INFINITE ALARM CLOCK* is the perfectly useless solution. Instead of a loud alarm that rudely interrupts your sleep, infinite 
alarm clock simply pretends to ring by printing ‚Äúalarm is ringing‚Äù on the screen. Ideal for anyone who needs to feel responsible without the hassle of actually waking up!
